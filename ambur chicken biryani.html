            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Ambur Chicken Biryani is a delightful South Indian dish cooked with short-grain Seeraga Samba rice.</p>
            <h2>ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>500 grams chicken pieces</li>
                <li>2 cups jeera samba rice</li>
                <li>2 onions, sliced</li>
                <li>2 tomatoes</li>
                <li>2 tablespoon ginger-garlic paste</li>
                <li>¼ cup thick curd</li>
                <li>4 tablespoon coriander-mint leaves, finely chopped</li>
                <li>4 cloves</li>
                <li>2 inch cinnamon stick</li>
                <li>1 bay leaf</li>
                <li>3 cardamom</li>
                <li>salt to taste</li>
                <li>¼ cup oil</li>
                <li>20 nos dried and grinded red chilies (adjust quantity as per spice preference)</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>First soak dried red chilies in water for minimum 30 minutes.</li>
                <li>Then grind it into a thick paste by adding very little water. Keep aside.</li>
                <li>Clean and wash chicken.</li>
                <li>Wash jeera samba rice and soak in water for minimum 30 minutes.</li>
                <li>Boil 3 liters of water in a large dish. Once water start to boil, add 1 tspn of salt and 1 tspn of oil and then add the soaked jeera rice.</li>
                <li>Cook it until it’s ¾th done. This is very important, do not over cook or fully cook the jeera rice, as we would be making biryani on dum you need the rice to be ¾ done.</li>
                <li>Once ¾ cooked, drain all the water and keep the cooked rice aside.</li>
                <li>Heat oil in a deep bottomed pan(I used pressure cooker). Add 1 tspn of curd and mix well. Be careful here the curd will splutter.</li>
                <li>Then add cloves, cinnamon, bay leaves and cardamom and mix.</li>
                <li>Next add 2 tbspns of sliced onions and mix.</li>
                <li>Add ginger-garlic paste and saute until the raw smell of the paste is gone.</li>
                <li>Add chicken and cook until the color of the chicken turns white.</li>
                <li>Then add 1 tbspn of chopped coriander and mint leaves and mix.</li>
                <li>Next add chopped onions and tomatoes and cook it until the tomatoes turn soft.</li>
                <li>Add ground red chili paste, salt to taste and mix well.</li>
                <li>Cook for another 5 minutes on medium flame.</li>
                <li>Add remaining curd, mix. Let it cook for another 2 minutes.</li>
                <li>By now the chicken should be ¾ cooked. Now it’s time to layer and put the biryani on dum cooking.</li>
                <li>I removed half of the chicken gravy mix into another bowl before adding the rice, as I wanted more layers. If you wish you can make just 1 layer.</li>
                <li>Add half of the cooked rice on top of the chicken layer, sprinkle coriander and mint leaves.</li>
                <li>Now add the second layer, by adding the chicken gravy we removed. Level it as much possible.</li>
                <li>Add the remaining rice, level it out.</li>
                <li>Place the dish on low heat, cover it and place a heavy item on top of the plate to trap the steam inside(I know this is not the authentic dum, but at home this is what is convenient).</li>
                <li>Let biryani cook for 20 minutes on dum heat.</li>
                <li>Ambur Star Biryani is ready. The biryani has a different dimension due to the jeera samba rice. The texture and the taste of this biryani is lip smacking good.</li>
                <li>Serve hot with onion raita and boiled egg. HEAVEN!</li>
